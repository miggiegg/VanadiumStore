		<div>Higher Revenue Share
We beat Amazon and other retailers for share. By bypassing third-party retailers, we eliminate royalties and increase percent shares of revenue so that our clients earn more for each product sold. 
Secure DownloadsFor digital purchases, customers receive an automated email with a unique download link that expires within 24 hours. Unlike Amazon’s 30% royalty fee, selling digital products on the Vanadium Store has a nominal 6% processing fee and a 0% royalty fee.
Storage and Shipping
Depending on the volume, works can be stored in our shop or a private warehouse. With access to major transportation networks, we partner with 3PLs to deliver product worldwide through land, air, and sea freight. 
</div>
		<div>Personalized Webpage
Each publication gets a beautiful and unique product page to showcase the work in a fashion not possible with other online retailers. For more special projects, we create its own website and additional marketing material to impress potential customers.
Unique PackagingWhen customers receive their purchase by mail, we add value to their purchase by customizing the packaging. Whether we include a thank-you note or environmentally friendly packing, we take the extra steps to impress our customers. 
Exceptional Customer ServiceVanadium Press can handle customer service requests, including refunds and questions. We also offer clients the option to connect with customers directly for comments, questions, and other customer service requests. It is another option for first-time authors to connect with their readers.
